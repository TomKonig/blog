Every &amp;ldquo;AI coding &amp;quot; app under the sun seems intent on making it as opaque and utterly confusing as possible to find out exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re paying, and what you&amp;rsquo;re even paying for. Worse still, the most expensive services seem to also be the worst, the least secure, and the ones with the most predatory lock-ins. But at least they have ✨aesthetics✨, I guess.&lt;/h4&gt;</description>
