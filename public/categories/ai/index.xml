      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I could have titled this blog post “&lt;mark&gt;how I tried to build an app with AI and really wish I hadn’t.&lt;/mark&gt;” I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will ever work as a hands-on content marketer again. But at least I learned to code again; the one thing the arbiters of agentic coding AI promised me I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now, considering the sorry state of LLM&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; benchmarks insofar as it concerns the probably only remotely reliable test for “generalized intelligence,” &#xA;&#xA;&lt;a class=&#34;link-icon&#34;&#xA;  href=&#34;https://agi.safe.ai&#34;&#xA;    target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&#xA;  &gt;Humanity’s Last Exam&lt;/a&#xA;&gt;, it is likely going to be a while before we have to contend with a globalized SkyNet coming to rapture us all to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seems, however, to be unfolding the demise of an early victim. It squeaks like a canary in the coal mine — if you will — of where unrelenting human greed and increasing automation is likely to drive us all eventually. I am, of course, talking about The App Store.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;youre-being-milked-and-it-is-only-partially-your-own-fault-every-ai-coding--app-under-the-sun-seems-intent-on-making-it-as-opaque-and-utterly-confusing-as-possible-to-find-out-exactly-what-youre-paying-and-what-youre-even-paying-for-worse-still-the-most-expensive-services-seem-to-also-be-the-worst-the-least-secure-and-the-ones-with-the-most-predatory-lock-ins-but-at-least-they-have-aesthetics-i-guess&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re being milked, and it is only partially your own fault. Every &amp;ldquo;AI coding &amp;quot; app under the sun seems intent on making it as opaque and utterly confusing as possible to find out exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re paying, and what you&amp;rsquo;re even paying for. Worse still, the most expensive services seem to also be the worst, the least secure, and the ones with the most predatory lock-ins. But at least they have ✨aesthetics✨, I guess.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash;more&amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;—&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;PS&lt;/strong&gt;: This post was written in a single session targeting vibecoding newbies with little to no code experience on a subreddit dedicated to vibecoding. Experienced developers will probably find no new information here. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome to read anyway, of course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
