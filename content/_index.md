{{< text_snippet TITLE="about me, briefly" >}}

first and foremost, I am a **journalist**, a **developer**, an **AI tinkerer**, and in love with digital communication and the internet. secondly, I am a dad, a concerned citizen, and skeptical of the intrinsically destructive nature of unfettered capitalism.

I write about **technology**, **AI**, **ethics**, **society**, and occasionally about **parenting** and **life** in general. I also sometimes complain about **journalism** and the **media industry**.
