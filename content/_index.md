I spend a lot of time writing technical documentation, tutorials, networking with people who also make and write things across the internet – this is where I get to say all the other stuff. sometimes it'll be informative, sometimes it'll be a rant, sometimes it'll just be an observation. I hope you make something of it."

{{< text_snippet title="About me, briefly">}}
{{< about AUTHOR="Thomas Kønig" AVATAR="avatar.png">}}
first and foremost, I am a **journalist**, a **developer**, an **AI tinkerer**, and in love with digital communication and the internet. secondly, I am a dad, a concerned citizen, and skeptical of the intrinsically destructive nature of unfettered capitalism.
\
I write about **technology**, **AI**, **ethics**, **society**, and occasionally about **parenting** and **life** in general. I also sometimes complain about **journalism** and the **media industry**.
